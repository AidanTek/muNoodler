# µNoodler Project
## Technical Files and Info for the µNoodler SAMD21G18A breakout

This project is for me to learn about a number of things, the idea being to build a SAMD21G18A MCU breakout from the ground up that can be used for Circuit Python, MicroPython or Arduino programming. You are welcome to use the files here for anything you want. 

This project was and is possible because of the amazing contributions towards OSH from Adafruit and Arduino - in support, please buy genuine products from these companies!

This is a work in progress! Aidan Taylor 2019

See the installation guide if you have a muNoodler board to experiment with. The Sketch directory provides code examples - contributions are welcome!
